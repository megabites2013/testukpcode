A simple rest application calculation the distance between 2 UK post codes



== Building

get the source and go to its directory, 

To launch unit tests:
```
./mvnw clean test
```
Unit test will start an embedded mongodb instance, and if your pc has firewall running it might pop up a dialog asking for permission of network connection


To package application:
```
./mvnw clean package
```



before run the application, you need to:

1. start a mongodb at localhost, with default port 27017  

2.prepare /data folder, if not exist just mkdir and give access, application will save log4j file into it

Tips:
use a mongodb docker image with volume (-v) attach to /data/db
you may want to use: sudo chmod -R 777 /data for easy demo 




To run application:
```
./mvnw clean exec:java
```

after it starts, you want to open a browser to try following address:


=get:

http://localhost:8080

http://localhost:8080/gui    (simple gui with CURD based on the rest API)

http://localhost:8080/api/postcode

http://localhost:8080/api/postcode/{a postcode id without bracket}


=post,put,delete also availible
the gui with CURD is based on the these rest APIs
